# TaskFlow
## Why?
The motivation behind TaskFlow is to provide a simplified Kanban board application akin to Trello, focusing solely on managing tasks within boards without the complexity of organizational features. TaskFlow aims to streamline task management for individuals and teams without overwhelming them with unnecessary functionalities.

## What?
TaskFlow is designed to offer users a straightforward platform for organizing tasks using the Kanban methodology. Users can create boards, add tasks to them, and move tasks between different stages of completion (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done). TaskFlow prioritizes simplicity and ease of use, focusing on the core aspects of task management without adding unnecessary complexity.

## How?
TaskFlow will be developed using the following technologies:
<ul>
  <li>React: For building the user interface and managing components efficiently.</li>
  <li>Node.js: For backend server-side logic and handling API requests.</li>
  <li>MongoDB: As the database to store board and task information.</li>
  <li>Express: As the web application framework for Node.js, facilitating the development of robust APIs.</li>
</ul>
